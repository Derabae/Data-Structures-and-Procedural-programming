# Problem 1: Sum of All Distinct Elements from Two Sets

**Description**: Given two sets, the algorithm calculates the sum of elements that are present in only one of the sets (distinct elements).

# Techniques Used:
- Arrays
- Nested loops
- Conditional logic

# Output:
```
Sum of all distinct elements is: 13
```

# Problem 2: Dot Product & Orthogonality Check

Description:
- A `dot_product` procedure and function were created.
- The dot product of two vectors is calculated.
- A check is made to determine whether the vectors are orthogonal (dot product = 0).

# Techniques Used:
- Arrays to represent vectors
- Nested loops
- Call by value and call by reference
- Procedures and Functions

# Sample Output:
```
Dot Product: 0
The vectors are orthogonal.
```
# Tools Used

- Pseudocode / Algorithmic thinking
- Manual test runs for result validation
